Git QUICKSTART

Hello, in order to get your local repository up, clone this repository by using
'git clone /home/students/stahl/os/project/git'

Then use
'git branch YOURNAME_dev' and
'git checkout YOURNAME_dev'
to create your branch and check it out (switch to it)

Set your local devlopment branch to track your development branch on the origin:
'git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>'
Where <branch> is YOURNAME_dev. I already created branches on the origin named:
kueny_dev
rahman_dev 

Then, just work like normal. When you've made changes, use
'git add <file>'
to add it to the staging area.

Use
'git commit'
to commit your changes in the staging area to your branch.

Use
'git push'
while in your branch to push your changes to your development branch on the origin, so we can all review it.
